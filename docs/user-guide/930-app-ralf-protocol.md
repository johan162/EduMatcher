# Appendix: RALF Protocol Reference

> **Status: Normative.** This appendix is the single source of truth for the RALF
> wire contract as implemented by `pm-ralf-gwy` (`ralf_gateway/`). For an operational,
> tutorial-style guide see [Post-Trade Dissemination](250-post-trade.md); for the
> gateway's configuration block see
> [Engine Config Specification §6.4](990-app-config-spec.md#64-post_trade_gateway-pm-ralf-gwy-ralf).

## 1. What RALF is

**RALF** (Reconciliation ALF) is EduMatcher's **text post-trade dissemination**
protocol. It streams executed-trade and end-of-day events over TCP to external
back-office consumers (clearing, drop-copy, audit). It is served by `pm-ralf-gwy`,
which subscribes to the engine event bus and re-publishes derived events as RALF
lines. RALF is **read-only**: clients subscribe and receive; they never submit orders.

## 2. Scope & conformance

This document defines the client-visible wire behaviour of RALF version token
`RALF1`: framing, message set, fields, roles, sequencing, timeouts, and errors. The
key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** are used per RFC 2119.
A conforming client or gateway MUST implement the message set in §6 with the field
constraints in §6 and §10. Behaviour not stated here is unspecified. Where the
current implementation deviates from what a robust protocol would require, the
deviation is called out with a **⚠ Known deviation** note and tracked in the
project's suspected-bugs report.

## 3. Transport & session model

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Transport | TCP |
| Default port | `5580` (`post_trade_gateway.port`) |
| Encoding | UTF-8 text lines |
| Delimiter | `\n` |
| Version token | `RALF1` |
| Connection model | long-lived, one authenticated session per connection |
| Direction | gateway → client for all data; client → gateway for control only |

A session proceeds: **connect → `HELLO` → `WELCOME` → one or more `SUB`/`UNSUB` →
event stream + heartbeats → `EXIT`/disconnect**. A client MUST send `HELLO` before
any other message; a non-`HELLO` first message is rejected with
`ERR|CODE=AUTH_REQUIRED`.

## 4. Wire format

Every message is one line:

```text
MSGTYPE|KEY=VALUE|KEY=VALUE|...\n
```

- `MSGTYPE` MUST be uppercase ASCII from `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`.
- Fields are `|`-delimited; each field is split into key/value on the **first** `=`.
- A parser MUST ignore unknown fields (forward compatibility) except where a field
  is required for validation.
- Values do not contain `|` or `\n`.

**Reserved cross-message keys** (present on most messages):

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `CH` | Channel: `CLEARING`, `DROP_COPY`, or `AUDIT` |
| `SYM` | Symbol filter (control) or event symbol (data); `*` = all |
| `SEQ` | Channel-local monotonic message sequence (see §8) |
| `TS` | UTC ISO-8601 timestamp with milliseconds and `Z` suffix |

## 5. Message catalog

| Message | Direction | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `HELLO` | client → gw | open session; authenticate role; optional replay checkpoint |
| `WELCOME` | gw → client | session accepted; negotiated parameters |
| `SUB` | client → gw | subscribe channel(s) × symbol scope |
| `UNSUB` | client → gw | remove subscriptions |
| `SNAP` | gw → client | subscription/recovery baseline (carries current `SEQ`) |
| `EXEC` | gw → client | one executed trade (post-trade view) |
| `EOD` | gw → client | end-of-day per-symbol summary marker |
| `HB` | gw → client | heartbeat when the stream is quiet |
| `PING` / `PONG` | client → gw / gw → client | liveness probe and reply |
| `EXIT` | gw → client | session terminated (e.g. idle timeout) |
| `ERR` | gw → client | protocol, entitlement, or replay error |

## 6. Message definitions

### `HELLO` (client → gateway)

| Field | Type | Req | Constraints |
|-------|------|:---:|-------------|
| `CLIENT` | string | ✔ | external client identifier (logging) |
| `PROTO` | string | ✔ | MUST equal `RALF1` |
| `ROLE` | enum | ✔ | one of `CLEARING`, `DROP_COPY`, `AUDIT`; MUST be in the gateway's `allowed_roles` |
| `LASTSEQ` | int | – | replay checkpoint; requests events with `SEQ > LASTSEQ` (see §8) |

Missing `CLIENT`/`PROTO`/`ROLE` → `ERR|CODE=AUTH_REQUIRED`. A `ROLE` outside
`allowed_roles` → `ERR|CODE=ENTITLEMENT_DENIED`. A non-integer `LASTSEQ` →
`ERR|CODE=BAD_MESSAGE`.

### `WELCOME` (gateway → client)

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `PROTO` | negotiated version (`RALF1`) |
| `GW` | gateway id (`post_trade_gateway.name`) |
| `ROLE` | accepted role |
| `REPLAY` | replay retention window, seconds (`replay_retention_sec`) |
| `HBINT` | heartbeat interval, seconds (`heartbeat_interval_sec`) |

### `SUB` / `UNSUB` (client → gateway)

| Field | Type | Req | Default | Constraints |
|-------|------|:---:|---------|-------------|
| `CH` | csv of channels | ✔ | — | each ∈ {`CLEARING`,`DROP_COPY`,`AUDIT`}; entitlement checked (§7) |
| `SYM` | csv of symbols or `*` | – | `*` | scope filter |

A subscription is the set of `(channel, symbol)` pairs. `SUB` is cumulative; `UNSUB`
removes matching pairs and is idempotent. After a `SUB`, the gateway emits one `SNAP`.
A missing/empty `CH` → `ERR|CODE=INVALID_CHANNEL`; an unknown channel →
`ERR|CODE=INVALID_CHANNEL`; a channel the role may not access →
`ERR|CODE=ENTITLEMENT_DENIED`.

### `SNAP` (gateway → client)

Baseline emitted after a `SUB` and on replay-miss recovery. Carries `CH` (the
subscribed channels, comma-joined), `SYM`, `SEQ` (the highest current sequence over
the `CH` set in that `SNAP`), and `TS`. RALF `SNAP` carries **no book/position
state** — it is a sequence baseline only.

### `EXEC` (gateway → client)

One line per executed trade, per subscribed channel.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `CH` `SYM` `SEQ` `TS` | envelope (§4) |
| `EXEC_ID` | execution id (engine trade id) |
| `MATCH_ID` | match id — **identical to `EXEC_ID`** in `RALF1` |
| `BUY_ORDER_ID` / `SELL_ORDER_ID` | resting/aggressing order ids |
| `BUY_GW` / `SELL_GW` | buy-side / sell-side gateway ids |
| `SIDE` | aggressor side (`BUY`/`SELL`) |
| `QTY` | executed quantity |
| `PX` | execution price (display units) |

A single trade is emitted **once per channel** (`CLEARING`, `DROP_COPY`, `AUDIT`),
each copy consuming its own `SEQ` (§8).

### `EOD` (gateway → client)

Per-symbol end-of-day marker, derived from the engine `system.eod` broadcast.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `CH` `SYM` `SEQ` `TS` | envelope |
| `TRADE_COUNT` | trades seen for the symbol this session |
| `EXEC_COUNT` | execution count — **identical to `TRADE_COUNT`** in `RALF1` |

`EOD` is emitted once per symbol on all three channels:
`CLEARING`, `DROP_COPY`, and `AUDIT`.

### `HB`, `PING`/`PONG`, `EXIT`

`HB|TS=…` is sent to authenticated clients when the stream is otherwise quiet
(cadence `HBINT`). A client MAY send `PING`; the gateway replies `PONG|TS=…`.
`EXIT|REASON=…|TS=…` signals gateway-initiated termination (e.g. `idle_timeout`).

## 7. Roles & entitlements

Roles and channels share the same three names. Entitlement rules:

| Role | May subscribe to |
|------|------------------|
| `CLEARING` | `CLEARING` only |
| `DROP_COPY` | `DROP_COPY` only |
| `AUDIT` | **any** channel (`CLEARING`, `DROP_COPY`, `AUDIT`) |

A role subscribing outside its entitlement receives `ERR|CODE=ENTITLEMENT_DENIED`.
Only roles listed in `post_trade_gateway.allowed_roles` may authenticate.

## 8. Sequencing & recovery

`SEQ` is maintained **per channel** (`CLEARING`, `DROP_COPY`, `AUDIT`).

- Within one channel, `SEQ` is strictly increasing by 1 per emitted line.
- Across different channels, `SEQ` values are independent and are not globally
  ordered or globally unique.
- Clients MUST do gap detection and ordering **within a given `CH` stream**, not
  across mixed channels.

`LASTSEQ` in `HELLO` is a single integer checkpoint. The gateway applies that same
threshold to each entitled channel independently and replays events where
`event.SEQ > LASTSEQ` for that event's channel.

**Replay.** If `HELLO` carries `LASTSEQ`, the gateway attempts to resend journalled
events with `SEQ > LASTSEQ` (per channel, as above) and only for channels the role
is entitled to receive (§7). If `LASTSEQ` predates the retained journal window for
any entitled channel (`replay_retention_sec`), the gateway emits
`ERR|CODE=REPLAY_MISS` followed by a `SNAP` baseline; the client MUST reset to that
baseline.

!!! warning "⚠ Known deviation — replay is entitlement-filtered but not subscription-filtered"
    Replay happens during `HELLO`, before any `SUB` is processed, so replay cannot
    apply symbol/channel subscription state from the current connection. The current
    gateway filters replay by role entitlement (§7), but does **not** filter by
    subscriptions.

## 9. Liveness & timeouts

| Parameter | Source | Default |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Heartbeat interval (`HBINT`) | `heartbeat_interval_sec` | 1 s |
| Idle timeout | `idle_timeout_sec` | 5 s |
| Replay retention (`REPLAY`) | `replay_retention_sec` | 86400 s |

The gateway sends `HB` when no other line has been sent within the heartbeat
interval. A session with no inbound activity for the idle timeout is dropped
(`EXIT|REASON=idle_timeout`). A client whose outbound queue exceeds
`max_client_queue` receives `ERR|CODE=SLOW_CLIENT` and is disconnected.

## 10. Error codes

| Code | Meaning / trigger |
|------|-------------------|
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | first message was not `HELLO`, or `HELLO` missing `CLIENT`/`PROTO`/`ROLE` |
| `BAD_MESSAGE` | unparseable line, unsupported message type, or malformed field (e.g. non-integer `LASTSEQ`) |
| `INVALID_CHANNEL` | `SUB` with missing/empty or unknown `CH` |
| `ENTITLEMENT_DENIED` | role not in `allowed_roles`, or channel outside the role's entitlement |
| `REPLAY_MISS` | requested `LASTSEQ` is older than the retained journal window |
| `SLOW_CLIENT` | outbound queue exceeded `max_client_queue`; session disconnected |

`ERR` carries `CODE` and a human-readable `DETAIL`, e.g.
`ERR|CODE=REPLAY_MISS|DETAIL=requested seq outside retention`.

## 11. Configuration reference

`pm-ralf-gwy` reads the `post_trade_gateway` block of `engine_config.yaml`
(consumed only by this process). Full field law is in
[Engine Config Specification §6.4](990-app-config-spec.md#64-post_trade_gateway-pm-ralf-gwy-ralf).

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `name` | `ralf-gwy01` | gateway id in `WELCOME\|GW=` |
| `bind_address` | `0.0.0.0` | TCP listen address |
| `port` | `5580` | TCP listen port |
| `replay_retention_sec` | `86400` | journal window; advertised as `WELCOME\|REPLAY=` |
| `heartbeat_interval_sec` | `1` | `HB` cadence; advertised as `WELCOME\|HBINT=` |
| `idle_timeout_sec` | `5` | inbound-idle disconnect |
| `max_client_queue` | `10000` | outbound backlog before `SLOW_CLIENT` |
| `allowed_roles` | `[CLEARING, DROP_COPY, AUDIT]` | roles permitted to authenticate |

## 12. Conformance notes

A conforming `RALF1` implementation:

- derives events solely from engine broadcasts: `trade.executed` → `EXEC`,
  `system.eod` → `EOD`. No other event families exist in `RALF1`.
- MUST send `HELLO`/`WELCOME` before any data; MUST reject pre-auth data with
  `AUTH_REQUIRED`.
- MUST enforce the §7 entitlement matrix on `SUB` (live path).
- MUST apply per-channel `SEQ` semantics from §8 (no global `SEQ` stream).
- MUST advertise `REPLAY`/`HBINT` in `WELCOME` matching its configuration.
- SHOULD treat replay as role-entitled but pre-`SUB` (therefore not
  subscription-filtered) on reconnect.

Future revisions may add `CORRECT`, `BUST`, `ALLOC`, and `SETTLE` event families as
the corresponding engine events become available; they are **not** part of `RALF1`.
