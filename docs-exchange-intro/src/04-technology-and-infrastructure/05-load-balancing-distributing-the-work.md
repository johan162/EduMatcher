# Load Balancing, Distributing the Work


A single exchange may serve dozens of gateways simultaneously, each handling orders from hundreds of participants. As trading volume grows, a single matching engine process may become a bottleneck.

## Horizontal Scaling Across Symbols

The most natural scaling approach for an exchange is to distribute different symbols across different matching engine instances. The AAPL book and the MSFT book are completely independent, they can run on different servers, different processes, even in different data centres.

This is called **partitioning by symbol**. It scales well: adding a new server lets you handle more symbols, without requiring coordination between servers (since no order crosses symbol boundaries except through combo order handling at a higher level).

## Gateway Load Balancing

Multiple gateway processes can run in parallel, each accepting connections from different participants. Gateways forward orders to the appropriate matching engine instance based on symbol. This allows gateway capacity to scale independently of matching engine capacity.

A **load balancer** sits in front of the gateways, distributing incoming participant connections across the available gateway processes. Participants typically do not know which specific gateway process they are connected to, the load balancer makes this transparent.

## The Unique Order Number Challenge

This is where scaling creates a genuinely complex problem, and it is worth understanding in detail.

Every order must have a **unique identifier**, a number or string that unambiguously identifies it across the entire system, forever. The order ID appears in trade records, audit logs, regulatory reports, and clearing messages. It must be:

1. **Unique:** No two orders should ever have the same ID.
2. **Monotonically increasing:** A later order should always have a higher (or at least not lower) ID than an earlier order. This property is valuable for sequencing, for detecting missed events, and for regulatory audit trails that can be sorted by order arrival.
3. **Globally consistent across sites:** If the primary site generates order ID 1000 and then the secondary takes over, the secondary must not also generate an order ID 1000 for a different order.

**The straightforward solution:** A single, central counter. Every time an order arrives, atomically increment the counter and assign the result. Order IDs are 1, 2, 3, 4... This is perfectly monotonic and unique.

**The problem:** A single central counter is a single point of failure. If that counter's database is unavailable, no new orders can be accepted, the entire exchange halts. It is also a bottleneck, every order, from every gateway, must go through the same counter.

**Solution 1: Pre-allocated ranges.** The primary site and secondary site each hold a pre-allocated range of IDs. The primary uses 1–1,000,000; the secondary uses 1,000,001–2,000,000. If the primary uses up its range and requests more, the allocation manager assigns the next block. If the primary fails and the secondary takes over, the secondary continues from its own unused range. No IDs collide, and no coordination is needed at order submission time.

The challenge: if the primary used IDs 1–50,000 before failing and the secondary starts from 1,000,001, there is a large gap in the ID sequence. This is not strictly a problem (the IDs are still unique and monotonically increasing) but it can confuse monitoring systems that expect dense sequences.

**Solution 2: Site-prefixed IDs.** Each site adds a prefix to its generated IDs: `P-000001` for primary, `S-000001` for secondary. IDs are unique because the prefixes differ. This is simple but makes IDs slightly longer, and "comparing" IDs (which one came first?) requires stripping the prefix.

**Solution 3: Time-based IDs.** Compose the ID from the nanosecond timestamp plus a site identifier plus a sequence number within that nanosecond. For example: `{timestamp_ns}{site_id}{seq}`. This is monotonically increasing (later timestamps = higher IDs), unique per site (different site IDs), and unique within a nanosecond (the sequence counter handles simultaneous orders). Used in various forms by high-volume systems. The challenge: the IDs become very large numbers.

**Solution 4: UUIDs.** A **UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)** is a 128-bit random or time-based identifier. UUID v4 is randomly generated; UUID v1 is based on time and network address. UUIDs are practically guaranteed unique without coordination. The drawback: they are not sequential, and they are large (32 hex characters). Sorting by UUID does not give you arrival order.

**In practice:** Exchange systems typically use a hybrid approach, a system like pre-allocated ranges for transaction ordering (where strict monotonicity matters), and UUIDs for order IDs in internal databases (where uniqueness is paramount and ordering can be handled separately by timestamp). A common approach uses UUID-based order IDs combined with monotonically increasing nanosecond timestamps to achieve both uniqueness and chronological ordering.

## Monotonic Timestamps Across Sites

The nanosecond timestamp on each order must be monotonically increasing, not just within one machine, but across the entire system. If the primary is generating timestamps and then the secondary takes over, the secondary cannot start generating timestamps smaller than the last one the primary generated.

This requires clock synchronisation (NTP or PTP), monotonic enforcement via a wrapper that guarantees strictly increasing values, and site coordination when the secondary takes over.

**An important nuance:** in practice, deterministic sequencing identifiers matter more than absolute wall-clock timestamp precision. Production exchange systems frequently tolerate small amounts of clock drift and same-timestamp collisions, because the canonical ordering of events is defined by **sequencing infrastructure**, the order in which the single-threaded engine processes messages from its queue, not by the wall-clock value of the timestamp. Timestamps are primarily for auditability and observability; the sequencing of the input queue defines what actually happens. The monotonic enforcement described here prevents the most obvious failures (a clock jumping backward and assigning a "past" timestamp to a new order), but it is the engine's input queue, not the clock, that ultimately determines priority.
