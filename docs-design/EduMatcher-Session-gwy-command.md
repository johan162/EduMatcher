# Design: `SESSION` Command for the FIX Gateway

**Feature:** Add a `SESSION` operational command to `pm-gateway` that displays the current trading session phase in a human-readable format.



## 1. Overview

Users connected to the gateway have no way to quickly see what trading phase the engine is currently in. This command fills that gap. When a user types `SESSION` in the gateway prompt, the gateway queries the engine and prints a status line such as:

```
[14:32:01.045] SESSION  CONTINUOUS  (Continuous Trading)
[14:32:01.045] SESSION  OPENING_AUCTION  (Opening Auction — orders collected, no matching)
[14:32:01.045] SESSION  CLOSING_AUCTION  (Closing Auction — orders collected, no matching)
[14:32:01.045] SESSION  PRE_OPEN  (Pre-Open — orders accepted, no matching)
[14:32:01.045] SESSION  CLOSED  (Market closed — no new orders accepted)
```

If the engine has sessions disabled (all orders are always accepted), it also indicates that:

```
[14:32:01.045] SESSION  CONTINUOUS  (Continuous Trading)  [sessions gating disabled]
```



## 2. What Already Exists — No Engine Changes Required

The engine already supports this query end-to-end. The complete infrastructure is already in place:

| Component | What exists |
|---|---|
| `SessionState` enum | `src/edumatcher/models/session.py` |
| Message builder (request) | `make_session_state_request_msg(gateway_id)` in `models/message.py` |
| Message builder (response) | `make_session_status_msg(gateway_id, state, sessions_enabled)` in `models/message.py` |
| Engine handler | `_handle_session_state_request(payload)` in `engine/main.py` |
| Engine dispatch entry | `elif topic == "system.session_state_request": ...` already in `engine/main.py` |
| Response ZMQ topic | `system.session_status.{GW_ID}` |

The only work required is **inside `gateway/main.py`**.


## 3. Session States Reference

Defined in `src/edumatcher/models/session.py`:

| `SessionState` value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PRE_OPEN` | Orders accepted, no matching yet |
| `OPENING_AUCTION` | Auction collection phase; uncross happens on transition out |
| `CONTINUOUS` | Normal continuous two-sided matching |
| `CLOSING_AUCTION` | Auction collection phase; uncross happens on transition out |
| `CLOSED` | No orders accepted; market is shut |

## 4. ZMQ Message Flow

```
Gateway                              Engine (PULL socket)
  │                                       │
  │─── PUSH "system.session_state_request" ──────────────────► │
  │    payload: {"gateway_id": "GW01"}                          │
  │                                                             │
  │    Engine calls _handle_session_state_request()             │
  │    and publishes response on PUB socket                     │
  │                                                             │
  │◄── SUB "system.session_status.GW01" ──────────────────────  │
  │    payload: {                                               │
  │      "state": "CONTINUOUS",                                 │
  │      "sessions_enabled": true                               │
  │    }                                                        │
  │                                                             │
  │  _handle_event() in background thread receives              │
  │  and calls _print_session_status(payload)                   │
```

This is the same fire-and-forget + async response pattern used by `SYMBOLS` and `ORDERS`. The gateway never blocks waiting for the reply — the background listener thread handles it.

## 5. Changes Required in `gateway/main.py`

There are four places to edit in this single file.

### 5.1 — Add `"SESSION"` to the top-level command list

Find `_TOP_LEVEL_CMDS` (near the top of the file):

```python
_TOP_LEVEL_CMDS = [
    "NEW",
    "QUOTE",
    ...
    "SYMBOLS",
    "HELP",
    "EXIT",
    "QUIT",
]
```

Add `"SESSION"` after `"SYMBOLS"`:

```python
_TOP_LEVEL_CMDS = [
    "NEW",
    "QUOTE",
    ...
    "SYMBOLS",
    "SESSION",   # ← add this line
    "HELP",
    "EXIT",
    "QUIT",
]
```

This ensures tab-completion offers `SESSION` when the user starts typing.



### 5.2 — Subscribe to the `system.session_status.*` topic

In `Gateway.__init__`, find the `make_subscriber(...)` call that sets up `self.sub_sock`. It lists all topics the gateway needs to receive. Add the session status topic:

```python
self.sub_sock = make_subscriber(
    ENGINE_PUB_ADDR,
    f"order.ack.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"order.fill.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"order.amended.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"order.cancelled.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"order.expired.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"order.orders.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"combo.ack.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"combo.status.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"oco.ack.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"oco.cancelled.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"quote.ack.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"quote.status.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"risk.kill_switch_ack.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"system.symbols.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"system.gateway_auth.{self.gateway_id}",
    f"system.session_status.{self.gateway_id}",  # ← add this line
    "trade.executed",
)
```

Without this subscription the gateway's SUB socket will silently drop the engine's response and nothing will be printed.



### 5.3 — Add the `SESSION` dispatch case in `_parse_and_send`

In `_parse_and_send`, the method that routes user commands, add a handler for `SESSION` alongside the existing `SYMBOLS` handler. The import for `make_session_state_request_msg` is already present at the top of the file — just add the handler:

```python
if cmd == "SYMBOLS":
    self.push_sock.send_multipart(make_symbols_request_msg(self.gateway_id))
    return

if cmd == "SESSION":
    self.push_sock.send_multipart(make_session_state_request_msg(self.gateway_id))
    return
```

Place it immediately after the `SYMBOLS` block for grouping consistency.



### 5.4 — Handle the response in `_handle_event`

In `_handle_event`, add a new `elif` branch to handle `system.session_status` topics. Place it after the `system.symbols` block:

```python
elif "system.symbols" in topic:
    # ... existing symbols handling ...

elif "system.session_status" in topic:
    self._handle_session_status(payload)
```

Then add the private helper method `_handle_session_status` to the `Gateway` class. A good place for it is right after `_print_positions`:

```python
# Human-readable descriptions for each session state
_SESSION_DESCRIPTIONS: dict[str, str] = {
    "PRE_OPEN":        "Pre-Open — orders accepted, no matching",
    "OPENING_AUCTION": "Opening Auction — orders collected, no matching",
    "CONTINUOUS":      "Continuous Trading",
    "CLOSING_AUCTION": "Closing Auction — orders collected, no matching",
    "CLOSED":          "Market Closed — no new orders accepted",
}

def _handle_session_status(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Print the current trading session state received from the engine."""
    ts = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S.%f")[:-3]
    state = payload.get("state", "UNKNOWN")
    sessions_enabled = payload.get("sessions_enabled", True)

    description = _SESSION_DESCRIPTIONS.get(state, state)

    # Pick a colour that conveys meaning at a glance
    colour_map = {
        "PRE_OPEN":        "yellow",
        "OPENING_AUCTION": "magenta",
        "CONTINUOUS":      "bright_green",
        "CLOSING_AUCTION": "magenta",
        "CLOSED":          "red",
    }
    colour = colour_map.get(state, "white")

    disabled_note = "" if sessions_enabled else "  [dim]\[sessions gating disabled][/dim]"
    console.print(
        f"[{ts}] [bold {colour}]SESSION[/bold {colour}]  "
        f"[{colour}]{state}[/{colour}]  "
        f"[dim]({description})[/dim]{disabled_note}"
    )
```

> **Note on `_SESSION_DESCRIPTIONS`:** define it as a module-level constant (outside the class) alongside the other module-level constants like `_HELP_TEXT` and `_TOP_LEVEL_CMDS`. This keeps it easy to maintain without touching the class internals.



### 5.5 — Update `_HELP_TEXT`

In the `_HELP_TEXT` string, add a line for `SESSION` in the list of operational commands near `SYMBOLS` and `ORDERS`:

```
  ORDERS      — show all outstanding orders for this gateway
  POS         — show current positions with P&L
  SYMBOLS     — list all active instruments in the engine
  SESSION     — show the current trading session phase
  HELP        — this message
  EXIT / QUIT — disconnect
```

## 6. Complete Change Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `gateway/main.py` | Add `"SESSION"` to `_TOP_LEVEL_CMDS` |
| `gateway/main.py` | Add `f"system.session_status.{self.gateway_id}"` to `make_subscriber(...)` in `__init__` |
| `gateway/main.py` | Add `SESSION` dispatch block in `_parse_and_send` |
| `gateway/main.py` | Add `elif "system.session_status" in topic` branch in `_handle_event` |
| `gateway/main.py` | Add `_SESSION_DESCRIPTIONS` module-level constant |
| `gateway/main.py` | Add `_handle_session_status(self, payload)` method to `Gateway` |
| `gateway/main.py` | Add `SESSION` line to `_HELP_TEXT` |

No changes are required to `models/message.py`, `engine/main.py`, or any other file.



## 7. Imports

The import for `make_session_state_request_msg` is already present in `gateway/main.py`. Verify by checking the import block for `edumatcher.models.message`:

```python
from edumatcher.models.message import (
    ...
    make_session_state_request_msg,   # already imported
    ...
)
```

If for any reason it is missing, add it there.



## 8. End-to-End Walk-Through

1. User types `SESSION` at the `[GW01]>` prompt and presses Enter.
2. `_parse_and_send("SESSION")` is called.
3. The `cmd == "SESSION"` branch sends `make_session_state_request_msg("GW01")` over the PUSH socket. This encodes topic `"system.session_state_request"` with `{"gateway_id": "GW01"}`.
4. The engine's PULL socket receives the message and dispatches to `_handle_session_state_request(payload)`.
5. The handler reads `self._session_state` (e.g. `SessionState.CONTINUOUS`) and `self._sessions_enabled` (e.g. `True`), then publishes a response on its PUB socket with topic `"system.session_status.GW01"` and payload `{"state": "CONTINUOUS", "sessions_enabled": true}`.
6. The gateway's background `_listen()` thread receives the message (because the SUB socket is subscribed to `"system.session_status.GW01"`).
7. `_handle_event` matches `"system.session_status" in topic` and calls `_handle_session_status(payload)`.
8. `_handle_session_status` prints the formatted status line to the terminal via `console.print(...)`.



## 9. Edge Cases and Testing Tips

**Sessions disabled:** When the engine is started without session gating (default for simple demos), `sessions_enabled` will be `False` in the payload. The gateway should still display the current state, with the `[sessions gating disabled]` note appended.

**Engine not running:** If the engine is not reachable, no response will arrive. The gateway will appear to hang silently after the user types `SESSION` — this is the same behaviour as `SYMBOLS` and `ORDERS`. No special error handling is needed here; the existing pattern is intentional.

**Testing manually:**
1. Start the engine: `poetry run pm-engine`
2. Start a gateway: `poetry run pm-gateway --id GW01`
3. Type `SESSION` — you should see the current state printed.
4. In another terminal, start the scheduler in rapid mode: `poetry run pm-scheduler --now`
5. Go back to the gateway and type `SESSION` several times as the scheduler fires transitions — the output should change from `PRE_OPEN` → `OPENING_AUCTION` → `CONTINUOUS` → `CLOSING_AUCTION` → `CLOSED`.

**Testing via the command client (automated):** The `ExchangeCommandClient` in `src/edumatcher/commands/client.py` already has a `session_status()` method that exercises the same engine handler. See `tests/test_commands.py` — `TestSessionStatus` — for the existing test cases. You do not need to write engine-level tests; the gateway change is thin UI plumbing.
